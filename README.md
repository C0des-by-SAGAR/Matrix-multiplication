# Matrix-multiplication
# Matrix Multiplication Documentation

## Introduction
This program performs matrix multiplication on two matrices using the C programming language. It takes input matrices from the user and multiplies them using the standard matrix multiplication algorithm.

## Usage
To use this program, follow these steps:

1. Open the terminal or command prompt.
2. Clone or download the code from the GitHub repository: [Matrix Multiplication](https://github.com/C0des-by-SAGAR/Matrix-multiplication).
3. Compile the code using a C compiler. For example, you can use GCC by running the command: `gcc matrix_multiplication.c -o matrix_multiplication`.
4. Run the program by executing the compiled binary. For example, on Linux, you can use the command: `./matrix_multiplication`.

## Functionality
This program performs the following tasks:

1. Takes two matrices as input from the user.
2. Checks if the matrices are compatible for multiplication.
3. Multiplies the matrices using the standard matrix multiplication algorithm.
4. Displays the resulting multiplied matrix.

## Code Structure
The code is structured as follows:

1. `main` function: The entry point of the program. It calls other functions to perform the matrix multiplication.
2. `inputMatrix` function: Takes input for the matrices from the user.
3. `multiplyMatrix` function: Performs the matrix multiplication using nested loops.
4. `displayMatrix` function: Displays the multiplied matrix.

## Dependencies
This program does not have any external dependencies. It only uses standard C libraries for input/output operations.
